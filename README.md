# css-landingpage
Odin Project: foundation landing page project


This page took about 3 sit-downs to complete. I peeked at some other code to see how things were nested but overall I'm satisfied with it. Obviously not great but visually it's not far off. 
Not optimized for mobile.
I'm confident that I can create a decent landing page or possibly a portfolio page (when the time is right) and make it much cleaner than this.
For now...time to move on, I've been working on and off on css foundations for a few months now and think I can get through most stuff.
One thing I learned is I don't yet know best practices for so many things...for example: I have more than one h2 tag. They are in different divs. How do I style each one the best way? Inline seems easiest but I don't think it's best.

Cheers!
